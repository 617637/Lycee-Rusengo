<h1>What is Rusengo Lycee ?</h1>

<div id="aboutme">
<h2> History of Lycee Rusengo</h2>

<li><h3>Beginning as a Mission School (1953)</h3></li>
<p> Lycée Saint Joseph de Rusengo, often just called Lycée Rusengo,
    started a long time ago in 1953. It is located in the Ruyigi area
    of Burundi. At first, it was set up as a Catholic conventional school.
    This means the school is run by a religious group called the Congregation
    of the Bene-Yozefu Brothers (Frères Bene-Yozefu). However, the school also 
    works closely with Burundi's Ministry of Education. This partnership allows
    the school to follow national education rules while also keeping its strong
    Catholic values and leadership.</p>

<li><h3>Growth and Education (Mid-20th Century to Today)</h3></li>
<p>Over the years, the Lycée became a very important place for learning 
    in the region. It grew to offer many different study tracks, including 
    Science, Modern Letters (like humanities subjects), and teacher training 
    programs. The school has focused on giving students a strong education 
    across many fields. Because of its hard work and good results, Lycée Rusengo 
    earned a strong reputation for excellence. It often performs very well in the 
    national exams, making it known as a "school of excellence."</p>

<li><h3>Modern Excellence and Student Life</h3></li>
<p>Today, Lycée Rusengo continues to be a high-quality school. 
    It makes sure students not only learn well in class but also 
    grow in other ways. Students can join many different clubs and 
    activities, like Football, Basketball, and clubs focused on the 
    environment, justice, and peace. This helps the students get a full 
    education. The school aims to keep a small number of students in each
    class (sometimes around 20) so teachers can give a lot of personal help. 
    This focus on strong teaching and a good learning environment is the main 
    reason Lycée Rusengo has been able to stay a top-ranked school in Burundi</p>
